Automate Job Applications for jobs on Angel.co using Selenium

## Description

Project Idea is not original in the least bit. Although a quick google search wasn't too productive on how to automate job applications, I knew a bud who did this. [Max Caudle](http://maxcaudle.com/contact) (aka Aux Cable aka Maison Caiby) mentioned this idea, and here is his [repo](https://github.com/MasonCaiby/auto_app).

But the issue I found with ripping off his code and using it myself is twofold:

1. He wrote his in Python. I don't understand Python and I like to understand what is going on...

2. I wanted to learn Selenium (not its intended use) and writing 'virtual tests' for sites..

This was mostly done to 'cover my bases' and really confirm my suspicion that blindly applying for jobs is a waste of time.

Some of the script navigates thru some filters that are pertinent during the time I'm applying so I needed to do a little more fine tuning of my search
